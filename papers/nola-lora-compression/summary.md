# NOLA: Compressing LoRA Using Linear Combination of Random Bases

Concept note from research statement: further compress LoRA adapters by representing each low-rank
update as a linear combination of random basis matrices (seeded generators) plus small coefficients.
Aligns with SeedLM philosophy, targeting adapter storage reduction.

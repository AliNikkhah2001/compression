# Vision Compression Benchmarks
[x] Datasets for vision compression baselines.

Use ImageNet-1k for full-scale tests, CIFAR-10/100 for rapid iterations, and COCO keypoints/detection
when evaluating transformer backbones (e.g., ViT compression). Include calibration subsets for
post-training quantization and sparse benchmarks mirroring Quantization Networks (CVPR 2019).

# SeedLM Simulation (reference repo)
[x] Pointer to upstream SeedLM simulation code for weight-generation experiments.

Upstream: https://github.com/alexander-camuto/seedlm-sim (public). Contains PRNG-based weight
reconstruction prototypes that can guide our block search and coefficient solvers. Keep this folder
as a pointer; clone the repo into a separate workspace or add as a submodule if we need direct code.
